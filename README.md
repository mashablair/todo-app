# todo-app for Watch & Code course by Gordon Zhu
Project for the Practical JS class by Gordon Zhu.

##About
The course 'Practical JavaScript' can be found here: http://watchandcode.com/courses/practical-javascript

This course teaches a practical application for JS.  The goal is to build a todo-list application.  We start with a super basic one.
Then in each version we add functionality, based on the new specs, and practice using new JS concepts.

The program is built in Plunker (plnkr.co):  https://embed.plnkr.co/7XGbITx7KkZPcMvJmei0/ because Plunker allows miltiple JS files for a project.

This repo is to show my progress of building this scalable app.

##Structure
Versions 1-6 are only written in HTML document with JS inlined.  Starting with Version 7, html and js are in two different linked documents.
